# Drumkit
Let's play some instrument....isn't interesting, we have developed this drumkit using html,css,javascript!
The point of this project is to have each key, when pressed, make a corresponding drum noise. It also uses CSS transitions and animations to make the project more interactive to the user. 

For the website, we only have seven buttons to display on the page, clicking upon which sound would be played. First we would add the DOCTYPE HTML format, then give a suitable title to the web page, in our case it is The Drum Kit .

CSS is used to style the different portions and make it more visually appealing.
